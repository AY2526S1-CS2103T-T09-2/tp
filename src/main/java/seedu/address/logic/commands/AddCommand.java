/**
 * Represents a base command for adding entities (such as members or events) to the address book.

 * This abstract class provides the shared command word and usage information for all
 * add-type commands, including {@code AddMemberCommand} and {@code AddEventCommand}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Usage examples:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Members:</b> {@code add member n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu y/1 r/President}</li>
 *   <li><b>Events:</b> {@code add event n/CS Workshop d/2025-12-30T13:00 v/NUS COM1-03}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each subclass of {@code AddCommand} defines how the corresponding entity is created
 * and added to the model.
