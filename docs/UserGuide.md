## Quick Start


1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed on your computer.<br>
> Checking your Java version:
> - Open a command terminal
> - Type `java -version` and press Enter
> - If Java is installed, you'll see the version number (e.g., `java version "17.0.1"`)
> - The first number should be 17
>
> If Java is not installed or the version is below 17:
> - Download and install Java 17 by following the guide:
    >   - [for Windows users](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html)
>   - [for Mac users](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html)
>   - [for Linux users](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html)
> - After installation, restart your terminal and verify the version again


2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/releases).


3. Copy the `.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ComClubConnect.


4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the `.jar` file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app contains some sample data and the layout is explained in coloured boxes.<br>

### Quick CLI Tutorial
- Click the command input box (bottom of the UI), type a command exactly as shown (prefixes like `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `y/`, `r/`, `d/`, `l/` are required), then press Enter.
- Typical response types:
- Success message with brief summary (e.g., “New event added: …”).
- List output after `list` or `find` showing matching member/event entries.
- Error message beginning with “Invalid command format!” or a validation message — read it carefully and retry.
- Example sequence:
1. `add member n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu y/1 r/President`
    - Expected output: “New person added: John Doe …”
2. `list member`
    - Expected output: member list including “John Doe”.
3. `find event n/Welcome`
    - Expected output: a filtered event list containing events with “Welcome” in the name.


5. Type your command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
   Some example commands you can try:


- `help` : Shows the help window that explains the command usage.
- `list member` : Lists all members.
- `list event` : Lists all events.
- `add member n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu y/1 r/President` : Adds a member named John Doe.
- `add event n/Welcome Tea d/2025-09-01T18:00 l/COM1-01-02` : Adds an event.
- `delete member 3` : Deletes the 3rd member shown in the current list.
- `clear event` : Deletes all events.
- `exit` : Exits the app.

## Features


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">


**Notes on command format**
- Some commands require a `TYPE` immediately after the command word: `member` or `event` (e.g., `add member`, `list event`).
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters you supply. For example, in `add member n/NAME`, `NAME` can be `John Doe`.
- Items in square brackets are optional. Items marked with `…` can repeat, including zero times.
- Parameters can be in any order for a command.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) are ignored.
- If you are using a PDF version, commands that wrap across lines may lose spaces when copied — retype if needed.

Prefix reference used in commands:
- `n/` name
- `p/` phone (8 digits, starts with 8 or 9)
- `e/` email (must end with `@u.nus.edu`)
- `y/` year of study (`1`–`4`)
- `r/` role(s) — alphanumeric, can appear multiple times
- `d/` date-time in ISO format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`
- `l/` location
</div>




### Viewing Help — `help`


Opens the Help window.


Format: `help`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> Press <code>F1</code> or use the Help menu to open the Help window quickly.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> If the Help window is minimized, running <code>help</code> again will not open a new window. Restore the minimized window instead.</div>


![help message](images/helpMessage.png)




### Adding Entries — `add`


Adds a member or an event.


Format (member): `add member n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL y/YEAR r/ROLE…`


- `PHONE` must be 8 digits and start with `8` or `9`.
- `EMAIL` must be a valid NUS email ending with `@u.nus.edu`.
- `YEAR` must be one of `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`.
- At least one `r/ROLE` must be provided; you can specify multiple roles.
- Duplicate check: member names are matched case-insensitively. Two members with the same name are considered duplicates.


Examples:
- `add member n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu y/1 r/President`
- `add member n/Jane Tan p/91234567 e/janetan@u.nus.edu y/3 r/Treasurer r/Logistics`


Format (event): `add event n/NAME d/DATE_TIME l/LOCATION`

- `DATE_TIME` must be ISO local date-time: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` (e.g., `2025-09-01T18:00`).


Examples:
- `add event n/Welcome Tea d/2025-09-01T18:00 l/COM1-01-02`
- `add event n/CS Workshop d/2025-12-30T14:30 l/NUS COM2`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> Use multiple <code>r/</code> prefixes to add several roles at once, e.g., <code>r/President r/TechLead</code>.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> Dates must include the <code>T</code> separator (e.g., <code>2025-09-01T18:00</code>). Emails must end with <code>@u.nus.edu</code>.</div>




### Listing Entries — `list`


Shows members or events and switches the main list view accordingly.


Format: `list TYPE`


- `TYPE` is either `member` or `event`.


Examples:
- `list member`
- `list event`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> After a successful <code>add</code> or <code>edit</code>, run <code>list</code> to refresh the view you care about.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> Extra words after <code>list TYPE</code> are not allowed (e.g., <code>list member now</code> is invalid).</div>




### Editing Entries — `edit`


Edits an existing member or event.


Format (member): `edit member INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [y/YEAR] [r/ROLE]…`


- Edits the member at `INDEX` (1-based) in the displayed members list.
- At least one optional field must be provided.
- Providing one or more `r/ROLE` values replaces all existing roles.
- To clear all roles, use `r/` with no value.
- Changing a member’s name to one that matches an existing member (case-insensitive) is not allowed.


Examples:
- `edit member 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@u.nus.edu`
- `edit member 2 n/Betsy Crower r/` (clears all roles)


Format (event): `edit event INDEX [n/NAME] [d/DATE_TIME] [l/LOCATION]`


Examples:
- `edit event 1 n/Welcome and Games Night`
- `edit event 2 d/2025-10-05T19:00 l/COM3-01-12`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> You can edit multiple fields in one command, e.g., <code>edit member 3 n/New Name p/91234567</code>.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> Ensure the <code>INDEX</code> refers to the currently displayed list (members vs. events).</div>




### Finding Entries — `find`


Finds members or events matching the given criteria. Matching is case-insensitive and by whole words.


Format (members):
- `find member n/KEYWORDS…` — Find by member name.
- `find member y/KEYWORDS…` — Find by year of study.


Examples:
- `find member n/Alex David`
- `find member y/1 2`


Format (events):
- `find event n/KEYWORDS…` — Find by event name.
- `find event l/KEYWORDS…` — Find by event location.


Examples:
- `find event n/Welcome`
- `find event l/UTown COM1`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> Combine multiple keywords to broaden the match, e.g., <code>find event n/Welcome Games</code>.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> Searching by roles is not supported; use member name or year instead.</div>




### Deleting Entries — `delete`

Deletes a member or event by its displayed index.


Format: `delete TYPE INDEX`


- `TYPE` is either `member` or `event`.
- `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the current list and must be a positive integer.


Examples:
- `delete member 2`
- `delete event 1`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> Use <code>list member</code> or <code>list event</code> just before deleting to avoid index confusion.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> Deletions cannot be undone. Double-check the index before confirming.</div>




### Clearing Entries — `clear`


Clears all members or all events.


Format: `clear TYPE`


- `TYPE` is either `member` or `event`.


Examples:
- `clear member`
- `clear event`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> Export a backup (copy the <code>data/addressbook.json</code> file) before bulk-clearing.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> This action deletes all entries of the chosen type. It cannot be undone.</div>




### Aliasing Commands — `alias`


Creates a custom alias for a command word. Aliases apply for the current app session.


Format: `alias COMMAND_WORD ALIAS`


- Supported `COMMAND_WORD`s: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`, `find`, `list`, `help`, `exit`, `alias`.
- `ALIAS` must be a single word and not a built-in command word.


Examples:
- `alias delete rm` — After this, `rm member 1` works like `delete member 1`.
- `alias list ls`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> Choose aliases that mirror your team’s habits, e.g., <code>rm</code> for <code>delete</code>.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> Aliases are not saved between app runs.</div>




### Exiting — `exit`


Exits the program.


Format: `exit`


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">✅ <strong>Tip:</strong> Data saves automatically — you don’t need to save before exiting.</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> If you see a file permission error while exiting, move the <code>.jar</code> to a folder you can write to and run again.</div>




### Saving Your Data


Data is saved to disk automatically after any command that changes data. No manual save is needed.




### Editing the Data File (Advanced)


Data is saved as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">⚠️ <strong>Caution:</strong> If the JSON format becomes invalid, the app will start with an empty data file on the next run. Make a backup first. Invalid values (e.g., non-<code>@u.nus.edu</code> emails or malformed dates) may cause unexpected behavior.</div>

## FAQ

- Can I import my existing member list from Excel/Google Sheets?
 - Not directly. You can copy key details and add members using `add member ...`. Power users can transform CSV to match `addressbook.json`, but be careful with format.


- Do aliases persist across restarts?
 - No. Aliases last for the current session only.


- Why does my email keep getting rejected?
 - Emails must end with `@u.nus.edu` and have a valid local-part (alphanumeric plus `+ _ . -`, not starting/ending with a special character).


- What phone numbers are allowed?
 - Exactly 8 digits, starting with `8` or `9`, and no spaces.


- How do I record multiple roles for a member?
 - Repeat the `r/` prefix, e.g., `r/President r/TechLead`. Roles are alphanumeric and cannot contain spaces.


- Can I search by role or by event date range?
 - Role-based search and date-range filters are not supported currently. You can search members by name or year, and events by name or location.


- I entered `2025-09-01 18:00` but got an invalid date. Why?
 - Use ISO format with `T` between date and time: `2025-09-01T18:00`.


- I deleted the wrong person/event. Can I undo?
 - Undo is not available. Consider exporting a backup (`data/addressbook.json`) periodically.


- How do I move my data to another computer?
 - Copy your `addressbook.json` from the `data` folder next to your `.jar` into the same location on the new machine before running the app there.


- The app says it can’t save due to permissions. What should I do?
 - Move the `.jar` file to a folder you have write access to (e.g., your home folder or desktop) and run it again.


- Can multiple EXCO members use the same data file?
 - Yes. Share the `addressbook.json` file via a cloud drive, but ensure only one person runs the app and edits the file at a time to avoid conflicts.


- Will names be treated as duplicates if capitalization differs?
 - Yes. Member name matching is case-insensitive for uniqueness (e.g., `John Doe` and `john doe` are considered the same).

## Troubleshooting


Problem: “Invalid command format!”
- Reason: Missing required parts or extra unexpected text.
- Solution: Compare with the command’s “Format” in this guide; remove extras and include all required prefixes.


Problem: “Phone number must be exactly 8 digits and start with 8 or 9.”
- Reason: The number contains spaces, wrong length, or starts with other digits.
- Solution: Enter an 8-digit number starting with 8 or 9, with no spaces.


Problem: “Emails should be of the format local-part@u.nus.edu …”
- Reason: Email is not an NUS email or local-part is invalid.
- Solution: Use a valid NUS email like `alexlee@u.nus.edu`.


Problem: “Dates should be in ISO format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM”
- Reason: Missing the `T` separator or wrong format.
- Solution: Enter `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` (e.g., `2025-10-05T19:00`).


Problem: “Unknown command”
- Reason: Typos or using a command that does not exist.
- Solution: Run `help` to see supported commands. Consider creating an alias for frequently used commands.


Problem: “Could not save data due to insufficient permissions …”
- Reason: The current folder is read-only.
- Solution: Move the `.jar` to a writable folder and run it again.

## Known Issues


1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to only the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen. Remedy: delete `preferences.json` in the app folder and start again.
2. If you minimize the Help window and run `help` again, the original Help window remains minimized and no new Help window appears. Remedy: restore the minimized Help window.
