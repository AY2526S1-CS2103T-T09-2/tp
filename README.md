* This project is **based on the [AddressBook-Level3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)** project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
  It extends the original design into a **specialized CLI-based application** built for **NUS CCA leaders** to manage **member information** and **event information** efficiently.

* **`ComClubConnect`** is developed as part of a **Software Engineering (SE) course project**, serving both as a **practical implementation** and a **learning tool**.<br>
  **Example usages:**
    * as a **starting point** for a course project focusing on real-world **CCA management use cases**
    * as a **reference case study** for understanding **user-centered design**, **feature scoping**, and **software documentation practices**
    * as a **training project** to practice **object-oriented programming**, **command-line UI design**, and **feature validation**

* The project simulates an **ongoing software system** designed for **desktop use**, aimed at simplifying **member management** and **event tracking** for CCAs in NUS.
    * It is **implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, providing a **clear and maintainable architecture**.
    * The code base is **adapted to meet CCA-specific needs** such as **member roles**, **attendance records**, and **event listings**, while keeping complexity **manageable for student developers**.
    * It includes **comprehensive documentation**, **user stories**, and **meeting logs**, reflecting the **iterative and collaborative nature** of software engineering projects.
    * For the detailed documentation of this project, see **[ComClubConnect Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-t09-2.github.io/tp/)**.
